# Categorical-KG

Category theory has been heavily applied in knowledge representation, especially in database theory, cf. [categoricaldata.net](https://www.categoricaldata.net). Can categorical-KR be useful in computation with ontologies, their embeddings and their alignment? 

Relevant literature - 
1. [Ologs: a categorical framework for knowledge representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1889) - by David I. Spivak, Robert E. Kent. 
  - Hallmark paper in categorical-KR, which leads to [categoricaldata.net](https://www.categoricaldata.net). 
2. [Lattice-preserving ALC ontology embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07163) by Fernando Zhapa-Camacho, Robert Hoehndorf 
  - Uses categorical formulation of description logics for lattice preserving ontology embeddings. 
3. Categorical formulations of Description Logics
  - [Category-theoretical Semantics of the Description Logic ALC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08837) by Chan Le Duc
  - [Reasoning in the Description Logic ALC under Category Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04911) by Ludovic Brieulle, Chan Le Duc, Pascal Vaillant.
4. [Knowledge Representation in Bicategories of Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00526) by Evan Patterson
  - introduces _relational ontology logs_ which have several useful features not possessed by most description logics, such as a type system and a rich, flexible notion of instance data.
5. [Representing Knowledge and Querying Data using Double-Functorial Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19884) by Michael Lambert, Evan Patterson

Idea: Can categorical logic or topos logic (like with suboject classifier in $\mathcal{C}$-**Inst**) be useful in KG computations? \[add further explanation of idea\]. [Add further explanation of idea]

\[Broader concept: CT for neurosymbolic AI - I have seen CT applied in other forms of computational logic too, see [PPLV](http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) group at UCL. Can the same be said about CT applications to temporal logic ([7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10258), [8](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.entcs.2012.08.015)), [modal](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/uni/fakultaeten/wiai_professuren/grundlagen_informatik/papersMM/conmodlog.pdf), [fuzzy](https://ijfs.usb.ac.ir/article_6077_9fa789612cdfd958226861183fbceac4.pdf) logics (given their relevance) for neuro-symbolic computation? Might be a nice way to model compositionality in neuro-symbolic computation\].
