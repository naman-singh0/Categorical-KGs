Categorical semantics of ALC description logic have been used to develop lattice preserving ALC ontology embeddings. These semantics help formalise structure among DL concepts which results in the lattice used for KG-embeddings. 

Categorical semantics of description logics follow the vein of CT applications to KR and databases, which have seen more than a decade of theoretical and practical development. 

\begin{definition} A double category $\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{D}_1\to \mathcal{D}_0$ consists of 
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item objects: objects $A,A',B,B'\dots$ of $\mathcal{D}_0$
        \item arrows (or vertical morphisms), which are the morphisms of $\mathcal{D}_0$ given by $f:A\rightarrow A'$
        \item (vertical) composition of arrows given by $f'\circ f$
        \item arrow identities $id_A$ for each object of $\mathcal{D}_0$
        \item proarrows (or horizontal morphisms), which are the objects of $\mathcal{D}_1$ given by $R:A\twoheadrightarrow B$
        \item (horizontal) composition of proarrows given by $R'\bullet R$
        \item proarrow identities $1_A$ for each object of $\mathcal{D}_0$
        \item 2-morphisms, which are the morphisms of $\mathcal{D}_1$, given by squares such as \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}
            A \arrow[r, "R", two heads] \arrow[d, "f"'] \arrow[d, "\alpha"', Rightarrow, shift left=9] & B \arrow[d, "g"] \\
            A' \arrow[r, "S"', two heads]                                                              & B'  
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        \item squares may be composed vertically ($\alpha'\circ\alpha$) and horizontally ($\beta\bullet\alpha$)
        \item vertical and horizontal identities for arrows ($1_R$) and proarrows ($id_f$) 
    \end{itemize}
    such that 
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item vertical and horizontal composition are associative and unitary on (pro)arrows and squares
        \item interchange law for vertical and horizontal composition of squares: $$(\beta'\circ\beta)\bullet(\alpha'\circ\alpha)=(\beta'\bullet\alpha')\circ(\beta\bullet\alpha)$$ 
        \item interchange law for identity squares: $1_{f'}\circ1_f = 1_{f'\circ f}$ , $id_{R'}\bullet id_R=id_{R'\bullet R}$, and $id_{1_A}=1_{id_A}$ 
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
