Categorical semantics of ALC description logic have been used to develop lattice preserving ALC ontology embeddings. These semantics help formalise structure among DL concepts which results in the lattice used for KG-embeddings. 

Categorical semantics of description logics follow the vein of CT applications to KR and databases, which have seen more than a decade of theoretical and practical development.
